Note on 3d printing:<br>
None of my files for 3d printing are truely cleaned and optimized for 3d printing.  I just don't have the time
to clean them up properly to be proper whole meshes without gaps.<br>
STL files with _cleaned on them are properly fixed meshes. (Rare)<br>
STL files with _reinforces are typically what I have to print with.  Those I've taken the PGI models and exported
them into Windows 3D Builder (the 3mf file).  I let 3D Builder repair the models and then save them a STL file.<br>
I then use Cura to slice them (0.05 layer height) and look for major voids, gaps, detatched parts, or parts that 
just won't print. I then go back to 3D Builder and position cubes, spheres, and cylindars to reinforce the print.<br>
I then re-export, and re-slice in Cura until I'm satisfied the 'Mech will print well enough.<br>
I was using a 0.02mm nozzle on my Robo 3D R1+ FDM printer.<br>
I'm now using an AnyCubic Photon DLP Resin printer and loving that.<br>
<br>


Note on 3d printing scale:<br>
I'll try to keep the 3mf & STL files in 6mm or N-Scale, equivilent to comercial miniatues.<br>
I like to print mine a little smaller at about 5mm scale.  So some of the files might be off.<br>
I use 30mm + tonnage/10 as a general guide, adjusting individual 'Mechs as they need.<br>
The smaller size fits on 1.75" heroscape tile with my trees: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2852387<br>

Also note on 3d printing:<br>
The antennas need to be beefed up as they will break off.  I typically just print as is and reaplace them post print 
with one of the long cylindrical printing supports I remove.<br>
